# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a simple, single-page application for scheduling appointments. Built using React, it allows users to create, edit, and delete appointments within an arbitrary week. Data is saved to an API server using PostgreSQL database.

Additional Note:
* The API server has been deployed on Heroku and the client on Netlify
